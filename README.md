# nodejs_PracticeProject_AuthUserMgmt - A Friends List Application Using Express Server with JWT

A collection of CRUD operations performed on transient data by creating API endpoints with an Express Server, restricting these operations to authenticated users using JWT and session authentication.

The friends object is a JSON/dictionary with email as the key and friends object as the value. The friends object is a dictionary with firstName, lastName, DOB mapped to their respective values. The “body” from the HTTP request is used, instead of “query” and “params”.

Only authenticated users are able to perform the CRUD operations.

Output of the endpoints were tested using Postman.
